     I'm Jack Brettell, and thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio. 
     Coding and development is my second career, as I got into it after many years in 
     wine and spirits sales. My passion is helping my clients achieve what they want to 
     convey in web, mobile and gaming platforms. I have many years of experience and many 
     positive reviews of my work. Please navigate to the portfolio page to view some of the
     work I've done for my clients. All inquiries can be sent by email or phone on the contact       page. Look forward to working with you soon!
     <br>
     In my spare time I enjoy running, climbing, sailing, and exploring the beautiful Pacific 
     Northwest.
